# Crowd UI

Crowd is a social network simulation framework which simplifies and fastens the process of developing agent-based models and simulations on networks. It is developed as a Python library, which also provides more advanced visualization through its graphical user interface. In this repository, you can find the source code of Crowd’s GUI, written with web technologies but wrapped as a desktop app which can be easily installed and run. Installers can be found on “Releases” section.
